# Hostel-Management-System

“HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” computerizes the management of Hostel to develop software, which is user friendly simple, fast, and cost – effective. It deals with the collection of student’s information along with their respective room-number. Traditionally, it was done manually. The main function of the system is to register and store student details and to retrieve these details as and when required, and also to manipulate these details meaningfully. System input contains student details, while system output is to get these details on to the screen. The above mentioned functionality is achieved by using FILES and LINKED LISTS. It is accessible by Hostel Administration. Only they can add and remove data into/from the database. The data can be retrieved easily.
